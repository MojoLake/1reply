## Ideas

1. cmd + enter should create a new line instead of sending the message.
2. lower survival time, maybe 5-10 messages? Then user can decide to go until 30.

3. content moderation
4. possibility to skip eg. choosing name and letting llm choose instead
5. tone can be whatever, doesn't need to be constrained to those.

- rename .env.local to .env.local.dev or something
